First of all, try just typing

 make

If you get some messages about undefined variables or (especially)
undefined symbols (ESPECIALLY) random(), try

 make SysV

If it still doesn't work and you're a C/Unix hack, just fix it - this
program is not rocket science - the only mildly weird stuff is how
it gathers timestamps and CPU usage from the OS.  When you're done
fixing it, email me (tbray@textuality.com) with what the problem was
and I'll roll your fix in.

If you can't fix it, email me all the details you can think of and
I'll try to fix it.
